Editors
=========

Two small self contained configuration editors for Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The Texture Max Load Editor and Level of Detail Radius Editors are designed to make the modification of their respective values in the flight simulator configuration file easier.

The code for these applications is no longer actively maintained but the editors still function with all versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator X including the Steam edition.

Known Issues
------------

 1. Some third party applications may wipe the exe.xml entry that this application creates. This application will make sure that it enters the code correctly and will not wipe any other entries.
 2. The custom controls were not compatible with larger DPI settings on some systems. The application will appear to be smaller if you use a larger DPI setting. This is so you can still use our custom controls.
