Texture Max Load Editor v2

Thank you for downloading and installing the Texture Max Load Editor. This application was designed to make the modification of the Texture Max Load value in the flight simulator configuration file easier.

---------------------------------------

Known Issues:
1. Some third party applications may wipe the exe.xml entry that this application creates. This application will make sure that it enters the code correctly and will not wipe any other entries. REX 2.0 is known to disable the Texture Max Load Editor from starting up.

2. The custom controls were not compatible with larger DPI settings on some systems. The application will appear to be smaller if you use a larger DPI setting. This is so you can still use our custom controls.
