Leve of Detail Radius Editor

Thank you for downloading and installing the Level of Detail Radius Editor. This application was designed to make the modification of the Level of Detail Radius value in the flight simulator configuration file easier.

---------------------------------------

Known Issues:
1. Some third party applications may wipe the exe.xml entry that this application creates. This application will make sure that it enters the code correctly and will not wipe any other entries.

2. The custom controls were not compatible with larger DPI settings on some systems. The application will appear to be smaller if you use a larger DPI setting. This is so you can still use our custom controls.
